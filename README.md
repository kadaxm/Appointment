# AI-Powered Appointment Scheduler (n8n)

This repository contains two connected **n8n workflows** that together create an AI-powered scheduling agent.  
The agent can talk to users via **Telegram**, collect their details step by step, check availability in **Google Calendar**, create **Zoom meeting links**, update a **Google Sheets** database, and send confirmation emails via **Gmail**.

The project demonstrates how conversational AI can be combined with automation tools to manage the entire lifecycle of appointment scheduling.

This workflow automates the entire process through natural conversation:

- The user interacts with an AI assistant ("Genvo") over Telegram.  
- Genvo asks for the required details, validates availability, and finalises the booking.  
- Calendar events, database entries, and email confirmations happen automatically in the background.
